### Project Overview
---

The aim of the project is to accurately predict insurance costs using the medical cost personal dataset.
It comprises 7 columns; age, sex, bmi, children,region smoker, charges

### Data Sources

The data sources includes: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance/code

### Proposed Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing Module (Python)
Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Visualization Module (Seaborn package on python)


### Tools
Database: MySQL Server (ERP data source)
Data Visualization: Python


### Milestones
1. Data Collection and import
# import dependencies
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

Preprocessing : Handling missing values and formatting

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

4. Visualization


### Data Analysis Code

### Results
The analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. Sales Trends: Through exploratory data analysis, we identified seasonal fluctuations and trends in sales across different regions and product categories in November.
2. Customer Behavior: Analysis revealed patterns in customer purchasing behavior, such as preferred products, order frequency, and order size.
3. Product Performance: Certain products showed consistently high sales, while others exhibited potential for improvement.
4. Regional Variances: Sales performance varied significantly across different regions, indicating opportunities for targeted marketing and sales strategies
5. Correlation: There's a positive correlation between both sales and acquisition rate.



 ### Recommendations
 Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns based on customer segmentation and purchasing patterns identified through data analysis.
- Optimize product offerings and pricing strategies based on insights into product performance and customer preferences.
- Strengthen distribution channels in regions with high sales potential and invest in sales force training and support.
- Leverage predictive modeling to forecast future sales and inventory requirements, enabling proactive inventory management



 ### Limitations

- Data Quality: The analysis is contingent upon the quality and completeness of the data extracted from the ERP system. Inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data may impact the validity of findings.
- Scope: The analysis focuses primarily on sales data and may not capture other factors influencing sales performance, such as market trends, competitor activities, or external economic factors.
- Technical Constraints: Limitations in computational resources or software capabilities may restrict the complexity of analysis or the scale of data processed.
- Generalizability: Findings and recommendations may not be universally applicable and should be interpreted within the context of the specific business and market environment
